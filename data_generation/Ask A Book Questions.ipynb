The Text:\\nThe house - the only one in the entire valley– sat on the crest of a low hill. From\\nthis height one would see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted with the flowers that\\nalways promised a good harvest. The only thing the earth needed was a downpour or\\nat least a shower. Throughout the morning Lencho–who knew his fields intimately–had\\ndone nothing else but see the sky towards the north-east.\\n“Now we’re really going to get some water, woman.” The woman who was\\npreparing supper, replied, “Yes, God willing”. The older boys were working in the field,\\nwhile the smaller ones were playing near the house until the woman called to them all,\\n“Come for dinner”. It was during the meal that, just as  Lencho had predicted , big\\ndrops of rain began to fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds could be seen\\napproaching. The air was fresh and sweet. The man went out for no other reason than\\nto have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body, and when he returned he exclaimed,\\n“These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins. The big drops are ten\\ncent pieces and the little ones are fives.”', metadata={'source': '../data/test3.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='9With a satisfied expression he regarded the field of ripe corn with its flowers,\\ndraped  in a curtain of rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with\\nthe rain very large hailstones began to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins.\\nThe boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out to collect the frozen pearls.\\n“It’s really getting bad now”, exclaimed the man. “I hope it passes quickly.” It did\\nnot pass quickly. For an hour the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, the\\ncornfield, on the whole valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.\\nNot a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed. The flowers\\nwere gone from the plants. Lencho’s soul was filled with sadness. When the storm had\\npassed, he stood in the middle of the field and said to his sons, “A plague of locusts\\nwould have left more than this. The hail has left nothing. This year we will have no corn.”\\nThat night was a sorrowful one.\\n“All our work, for nothing.”\\n“There’s no one who can help us.”\\n“We’ll all go hungry this year.”\\nBut in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary  house in the middle of the valley,\\nthere was a single hope: help from God.\\n“Don’t be so  upset , even though this seems like a total loss. Remember, no one\\ndies of hunger.”\\n“That’s what they say : no one dies of hunger.”\\nAll through the night, Lencho thought only of one hope: the help of God, whose\\neyes, as he had been instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.\\nLencho was an ox of a man, working like an animal in the fields, but still he knew how to\\nwrite. The following Sunday, at daybreak, he began to write a letter which he himself\\nwould carry to town and place in the mail. It was nothing less than a letter to God.', metadata={'source': '../data/test3.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

At the post office, he placed a stamp on the letter and dropped it into the mailbox.\\nOne of the employees, who was a postman and also helped at the post office,\\nwent to his boss laughing heartily and showed him the letter to God. Never in his career\\nas a postman had he known that address. The postmaster– a fat, amiable  fellow–also\\nbroke out laughing, but almost immediately he turned serious and, tapping the letter on\\nhis desk, commented, “What faith ! I wish I had the faith of the man who wrote this letter.\\nStarting up a correspondence  with God !”\\nSo, in order not to shake the writer’s faith in God, the postmaster came up with an\\nidea: answer the letter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to answer it he needed\\nsomething more than goodwill, ink and paper. But he stuck to his resolution:  he asked\\nfor money from his employees, he himself gave part of his salary, and several friends of\\nhis were obliged to give something ‘for an act of charity’.\\nIt was impossible for him to gather together the hundred pesos, so he was able to\\nsend the farmer only a little more than half. He put the money in an envelope addressed\\nto Lencho and with it a letter containing only a single word as a signature : God.\\nThe following Sunday Lencho came a bit earlier than usual to ask if there was a\\nletter for him. It was the postman himself who handed the letter to him while the\\npostmaster, experiencing the contentment  of a man who has performed a good deed,\\nlooked on from his office.\\nLencho showed not the slightest surprise on seeing the money; such was his\\nconfidence- but he became angry when he counted the money.

On the public\\nwriting-table, he started to write, with much wrinkling of his brow, caused by the effort he\\nhad to make to express his ideas. When he finished, he went to the window to buy a\\nstamp which he licked and then affixed to the envelope with a blow of his fist.
