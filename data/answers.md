The concept of false reverence, also known as false respect, refers to the act of showing respect or admiration towards someone or something without genuinely feeling or believing in it. It is a form of insincere or superficial respect that is often driven by external factors such as societal norms, fear, or the desire for personal gain.

False reverence can also manifest in the way we evaluate and judge others. It occurs when we over-evaluate, under-evaluate, or evaluate someone based on criteria that are not relevant or accurate. This can lead to misunderstandings, discomfort, and a lack of genuine respect in relationships.

In summary, false reverence is the act of showing respect or admiration without truly feeling or believing in it. It is often driven by external factors and can result in insincerity, superficiality, and a lack of genuine respect in relationships.

We tend to prioritize the continuous needs of the Self, such as happiness, over the health of the body.

Self-regulation is essential to maintain health because it allows the body to function properly and maintain balance. For example, the cycle of water in nature is self-regulated, with water evaporating, condensing, and precipitating back to water. Similarly, breeds of plants and animals in a forest are self-regulated, ensuring that the population proportions remain balanced. In terms of human health, self-regulation can be seen in practices such as proper nutrition, exercise, and stress management. When individuals practice self-regulation in these areas, they are able to maintain their health and prevent diseases.

### 59. ‘If I trust the intention of everyone, people will take undue advantage of me’. Is this statement true or false? Explain.
False. Trusting the intention of everyone does not mean that people will take undue advantage of you. In fact, having trust in the intention of others gives you inner strength and allows you to interact with people more effectively. When you trust someone's intention, you are able to see their true desires and intentions, even if they may not be aware of it themselves. This understanding helps you to become a help to others and prevents you from getting hurt or disturbed. People can only take advantage of you if you do not have the right understanding, not because you trust their intention.

### 60. Distinguish between reaction and response with the clarity of feeling of trust. Give on e example of each for a particular case relationship.
Reaction refers to an immediate and impulsive emotional response to a situation or stimulus.

For example, if a colleague makes a mistake at work, a reaction would be getting angry and blaming them without giving them the benefit of the doubt.

On the other hand, response refers to a thoughtful and considered action or behavior in a given situation. In the context of trust, a response would be acknowledging the competence of the other person while addressing any concerns or issues. For example, if a friend cancels plans last minute, a response would be expressing understanding and discussing alternative options rather than getting angry or irritated.
